# Neural-Network-Classification-Algorithms

This contains the implementation for popular CNN classification algorithms. Currently, it contains the AlexNet which made the AI world turn to deep learning, and the VGG which made us believe there's more to come from deep learning. Very soon, others will follow.

Thanks for using the repository!
