# Neural-Network-Classification-Algorithms

This contains the implementation for popular CNN classification algorithms. Currently, it contains the AlexNet which made the AI world turn to deep learning, and the VGG which made us believe there's more to come from deep learning. Very soon, others will follow.

How to use
1. Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed
2. Open any of the ipynb files using Jupyter notebook 
3. Tweak some of the preloaded configurations and change the datasets
4. Enjoy this small repository!
5. More to come soon.
